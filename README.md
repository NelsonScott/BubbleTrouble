# BubbleTrouble

[Live Demo](http://nelsonscott.github.io/BubbleTrouble/)

BubbleTrouble is a clone of the classic flash game.  The goal is to pop the bubbles bouncing around the screen using a harpoon.  Players control their character by using the arrow keys or 'a' and 'd', using spacebar to shoot above them.  If a player hits a sufficiently large bubble it will split into two more bubbles, otherwise it will pop.  To destroy multiple bubbles at once, try to push the bubble up to the ceiling against the spikes.
